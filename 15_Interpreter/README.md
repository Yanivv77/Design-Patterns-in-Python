# Interpreter
* A component that processes structured text data. Does so by turning it into
  separate lexical tokens (lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said
  tokens (parsing)

## Why to use Interpreter pattern
    - Barring simple cases, an interpreter acts in two stages
    - Lexing turns text into a set of tokens
    - Parsing tokens into meaningful construct
