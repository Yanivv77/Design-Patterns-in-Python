# Facade
 * Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a
  large and sophisticated body of code

## Why to use Facade pattern
- Balancing complexity and presentation/usability
- Typical home
  - Many subsystems (electrical, sanitation)
  - Complex internal structure (e.g., floor layers)
  - End users is not exposed to internals
- Same with software!
  - Many systems working to provide flexibility, but...
  - API consumers want it to 'just work'
