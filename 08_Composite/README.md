# Composite
 * A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and composition of
  objects in a uniform matter

## Why to use Composite pattern
- Objects use others' properties/members through inheritance and composition
- Composition lets us make compound objects
  - E.g., a mathematical expression composed of simple expressions; or
  - A grouping of shapes that consists of several shapes
- Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite
  objects uniformly
  - I.e., Foo and Sequence (yielding Foo's) have common APIs
