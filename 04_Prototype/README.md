# Prototype
 * A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of

## Why to use Prototype pattern
 * Complicated objects (e.g., cars) aren't designed from scratch
   - They iterate exists designs
 * An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype
 * We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
   - Requires a 'deep copy' support
* We make the cloning convenient (e.g., via a Factory)
