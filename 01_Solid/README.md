# Solid
SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable

## Single_Responsibility_Principle
* A class should have only one reason to change
* Separation of concerns  - different classes handling different independent task/problem

## Open-closed principle
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
