# Solid
SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable

## Single Responsibility Principle
* A class should have only one reason to change
* Separation of concerns  - different classes handling different independent task/problem

## Open-closed principle
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
  
## Liskov Substitution Principle
*  You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype
  
  ## Interface Segregation Principle
* Don't put too much into an interface
* Split into separate interfaces
* YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It
  
 ## Dependency Inversion Principle
* High level modules should not depend on low level ones
* Use abstractions
